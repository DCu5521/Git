#These are the suggestions and instructions given to the Lead and Junior Devolopers and any other developers from the DevOps Engineer for this case study.



Here is an example of a strategy that a DevOps Engineer might give to the developers on how to use the VCS for this case study:

1. Suggested VCS: Git downloaded to terminal. A software such as PyCharm to run Python code (or any other software that can run code used. A GitHub or Gitlab active account with rights and permission granted for access.
2. Strategy:


-All developers should use Git as the VCS for this project.
-Each developer should fork the repository from the given link https://github.com/edureka-devops/walletAPI.git
-Each developer should have their own branch for the development of the project, where they will make changes and commit them.
-The Lead Developer should create a master branch, where they will commit the interfaces so that other developers can follow the same approach.
-The Lead Developer should create a feature branch for each feature they are working on.
-The Lead Developer should merge the feature branch into the develop branch once testing is done.
-The Junior Developer should create a new branch for logging, and merge it into the develop branch once testing is done.
-Once testing is done, the Lead Developer should merge the develop branch into the master branch.
-Before merging, each developer should make sure that their branch is up-to-date with the base branch they are proposing changes to.
-Developers should use Pull Requests to propose changes to the base branch.
-Create tags for each release that is deployed to production.



Additional suggestions below:

-Developers should use Git Flow as a branching model for this project, which is a popular branching model for Git that helps in managing branches and releases.
-Developers should use a feature branch for each new feature they are working on, and should merge it into the develop branch once it is complete and tested.
-Developers should use a develop branch to integrate the changes of all feature branches.
-Developers should use a master branch to store the stable version of the code that is deployed to production.
-Developers should use a release branch to prepare a new release, this branch should be created from the develop branch and should be merged into the master branch once it is tested and ready to be deployed.
-Developers should use a hotfix branch to fix critical bugs that need to be fixed immediately. This branch should be created from the master branch and should be merged into the master and develop branches.
-Developers should use pull requests to review and merge changes into the develop branch, this will help in keeping the codebase clean and avoid conflicts.
-Developers should use tags to mark specific versions of the code, this will help in identifying and rollbacking to specific versions of the codebase.
-Developers should use git hooks to automate the process of testing, building, and deploying the codebase.
-Developers should use GitLab CI/CD to automate the process of building, testing, and deploying the codebase.


By following this strategy, developers will be able to collaborate effectively, keep the codebase clean and organized, and easily track and rollback to specific versions of the codebase.
